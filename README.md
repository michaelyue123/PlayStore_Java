# PlayStore_Java
A **PlayStore** is a standalone digital marketplace that allows users to browse and download mobile applications (APPs). The PlayStore also serves as a digital store offering publications like e-books and digital magazines. Applications and publication items in the PlayStore are either free or can be bought for a price.
The program I have created will allow the creation of a store, filling it with products, creating users and simulating their interaction with the store (purchasing products, adding comments etc).

## Program Execution
```
javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
